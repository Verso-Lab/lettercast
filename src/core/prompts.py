## TLDR
[1-2 punchy sentences that:
- Identify the episode premise, name the key speaker(s), and identify them fully
- Work like a headline or hook
- Maintain clear attribution
- Examples:
  - GOOD: "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gets surprisingly candid about OpenAI's AGI timeline in this no-holds-barred chat with host Kara Swisher"
  - GOOD: "Nobel laureate and gene-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna shares how her lab's new CRISPR-Omega system eliminated MRSA in 94% of trial patients—and why this discovery almost didn't happen"
]

## The big picture
[2-3 sentences that:
- Focus on the episode's value proposition and scope
- Explain what listeners will learn
- Describe the perspectives represented
- Show how the topic is explored
- Examples:
  - GOOD: "What starts as a technical discussion about AI safety turns into a fascinating debate between tech's biggest optimist and its sharpest critic. The conversation weaves through practical safeguards and philosophical dilemmas, making complex concepts surprisingly accessible while challenging the usual AI narratives."
  - GOOD: "Doudna walks us through the 3-year journey from a failed experiment with staph bacteria to a breakthrough in treating antibiotic-resistant infections. She details how her team's accidental discovery of the CAS-27 protein led to CRISPR-Omega, now in Phase III trials at Mayo Clinic and Stanford Hospital. The conversation covers both the technical innovations and the ethical challenges of deploying genetic engineering in emergency medicine."

## Highlights
[2-3 key moments that:
- Focus on specific, concrete exchanges or revelations (include the specifics)
- Attribute the moment to the appropriate speakers
- Capture surprising admissions or disagreements
