Key elements:

### Worth your time if...
[Think through:
1. What specific aspect of this episode would surprise or delight someone?
2. Think "You've ever wondered if your cat is actually an alien" rather than "You're interested in pets". 
3. Make a non-obvious connection that's unique to THIS episode.
4. One sentence, short and stunning.
Then: Complete the sentence in a way that's both specific and unexpected, but remain neutral and journalistic and don't insult anybody]

Before submitting, verify:
1. Have you verified every quote and detail in the audio?
